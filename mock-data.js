      Year: 2024,
      RaceNo: 1,
      RaceName: 'Bahrain Grand Prix',
      Constructor: 'Oracle Red Bull Racing',
      ComponentNo: 1,
      UpdatedComponent: 'Front Wing',
      PrimaryReason: 'Performance - Local Load',
      GeometricDifferences: 'Re-optimised wing elements to better attain the pressure gradients and more stable load.',
      Description: 'Load has beeen increased as pressure gradient targets were met, so this wing has more load than last years whilst maintaing the stability.'

      RaceName: 'Bahrain Grand Prix',
      Constructor: 'Oracle Red Bull Racing',
      ComponentNo: 2,
      UpdatedComponent: 'Nose',
      PrimaryReason: 'Performance - Flow Conditioning',
      GeometricDifferences: 'Better fairing to the front wing elements and a better pressure control along the length.',
      Description: 'Revised to fit the local changes in the front wing profiles and then tapered to meet the front bulkhead whislt observing the taper requirements to better condition the flow for bodywork downstreeam'

      RaceName: 'Bahrain Grand Prix',
      Constructor: 'Oracle Red Bull Racing',
      ComponentNo: 3,
      UpdatedComponent: 'Sidepod Inlet',
      PrimaryReason: 'Circuit specific - Cooling Range',
      GeometricDifferences: 'A better inlet shape for the pressure field available to supply the primary heat exchangers',
      Description: 'For greater efficiency, the inlet shape has been revised to better utilise the avaialble pressure to feed the radiators or primary heat exchangers downstream enabling the external profile to be less detrimental to the floor edge detail.'

      Constructor: 'Oracle Red Bull Racing',
      ComponentNo: 4,
      UpdatedComponent: 'Floor Edge',
      PrimaryReason: 'Performance - Local Load',
      GeometricDifferences: 'More aggressive geometry in the FEW to attain locally greater pressure differences',
      Description: 'Taking inspiration from competitor cars, shapes creating more local load were derived whilst mainaining adequate stability.'
